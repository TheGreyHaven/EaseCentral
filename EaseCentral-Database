-- Part Two Database Project:
-- Goal is to keep track of people who have multiple addresses and multiple phone numbers

-- Please create a relational database schema and show examples of the following queries:

-- - Display people and their phone numbers
-- - Display people and their addresses
-- - Display people and their addresses only if they are in the state of California
-- - Show how many people have addresses in each state
-- - Show the % of people that have multiple addresses

-- This is not a hosted solution. You do not have to create the database specifically. Just show the schema and SQL queries
-- from standard relational SQL databases like mysql or postgresql. ______________________________________________________________________________________________


CREATE TABLE phones(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, number VARCHAR(10), p_id INTEGER REFERENCES people);

CREATE TABLE addresses(a_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, street VARCHAR(20), state VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL, p_id  INTEGER REFERENCES people);

CREATE TABLE people(p_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, postgres(name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL);


-- 1) Display people and their phone numbers:
	-- (Here I am selecting all people regardless of weather or not they have a number. If we only want people who have a number we can just do JOIN instead of Left JOIN)
SELECT
	people.name,
	phones.number
FROM people
LEFT JOIN phones
USING (p_id);


-- 2) Display people and their addresses:
	-- (Here I am selecting all people regardless of weather or not they have an addresses. If we only want people who have an address we can just do JOIN instead of Left JOIN)
SELECT
	people.name,
	addresses.street,
	addresses.state
FROM people
LEFT JOIN addresses
USING (p_id);


-- 3) Display people and their addresses only if they are in the state of California:
SELECT
	people.name,
	addresses.street,
	addresses.state
FROM people
JOIN addresses
USING (p_id)
WHERE addresses.state='CA';


-- 4) Show how many people have addresses in each state:
SELECT
	state,
	COUNT(*)
FROM addresses
GROUP BY state;


-- 5) Show the % of people that have multiple addresses:
SELECT
(
	(
		(
			SELECT
				SUM(total)
			FROM
			(
				SELECT
					COUNT(DISTINCT p_id) AS total
				FROM addresses
				GROUP BY p_id
				HAVING COUNT(a_id) > 1
			) AS find_total
		)
		/ COUNT(DISTINCT people.p_id)::decimal
	) * 100
)::decimal(5)
FROM people
LEFT JOIN addresses
USING (p_id);
